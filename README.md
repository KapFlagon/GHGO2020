# Imoonity
A Godot engine game, initially intended for the Github Game Off 2020. 
We decided to miss that submission deadline, and instead work on the game with a bit less time pressure. 
We want to finish the project to at least a version that we are pleased with for release. 
Will be playable at this Itch.io link: [Imoonity] ()
